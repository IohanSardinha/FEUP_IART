The given problem consists of a dataset of symptoms and associated deseases that can be either Covid-19, Flu, Common Cold or allergy.

The goal of the machine learning model is to determine what's the most probable deasese an infected person has based on their symptoms.

This way this the problem can be interpreted as a classification problem with four classes: Alergy, Covid, Flu and Cold. And twenty binary-valued attributes corresponding to the studied symptoms.
